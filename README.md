This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an uncommon code error related to the post-increment operator in a `while` loop. The program intends to print numbers from 0 to 9, but due to the placement of the increment operator, it prints numbers from 1 to 10 instead. The solution file shows how to correct the code to achieve the intended behavior.  The error is subtle and highlights the importance of understanding operator precedence in programming.
